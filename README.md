Based on [spacehuhn's PacketMonitor](https://github.com/spacehuhn/PacketMonitor)

A modified version of [WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager) and an old version of [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson) are included

Requires [NeoPixelBus](https://github.com/Makuna/NeoPixelBus) and [CapacitiveSensor](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/CapacitiveSensor) libraries

The attack-detector counts deauth packets but it's a bit sensitive (and useless).
